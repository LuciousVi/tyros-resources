# I need some help to decide how I should spend my time! I can do the following
# things depending on what is happening tomorrow:

# * Sleep early (if I have completed my homework or none of my friends are
#   online, and there is no school tomorrow)
# * Homework (if there is school tomorrow)
# * Play some games (if I have friends online and there is no school tomorrow)

# Write a program that allows me to input if I have school tomorrow, if I have
# completed my homework and if I have friends online, then print what I should
# do!
